## 🔍 Keyword Research Guide

Keyword research is the foundation of any successful SEO strategy. It helps you discover what your audience is searching for—and how to create content that meets their intent.

### ✅ 1. Understand Search Intent
There are 4 main types of search intent:
- **Informational** – Users want to learn something (e.g., "what is digital marketing")
- **Navigational** – Users want a specific site (e.g., "YouTube login")
- **Transactional** – Users want to buy (e.g., "buy iPhone 15 online")
- **Commercial investigation** – Users are comparing (e.g., "best email tools 2025")

Choose keywords that align with your goal.

### 🛠️ 2. Tools for Keyword Research

### 📊 3. Analyze the Data
Look at:
- **Search Volume** – How many people search this term per month?
- **Keyword Difficulty (KD)** – How competitive is this term?
- **CPC (Cost Per Click)** – Shows how valuable the term is for advertisers
- **Trends** – Is it seasonal or evergreen?

### 🔑 4. Find Long-Tail Keywords
Long-tail keywords = more specific, lower competition
- "digital marketing" → broad
- "digital marketing for local restaurants 2025" → long-tail

These are easier to rank and bring targeted traffic.

### 🧩 5. Use Keyword Clusters
Group related keywords and cover them in one topic. Example:
- Main: "email marketing tools"
- Cluster: "free email marketing software", "best email tools for small business", "Mailchimp alternatives"

Use them naturally in subheadings and content.

### ✍️ 6. Use Keywords Strategically
Place keywords in:
- Title tag
- Meta description
- URL
- H1 tag
- First 100 words
- Image alt tags
- Throughout content (but don’t overdo it!)

### 🔁 7. Keep Updating
SEO is not one-time. Keep finding new keywords, tracking trends, and updating your content.

### 🎯 Final Tip
Always prioritize what your audience is truly searching for—not just what has high search volume. Relevance + intent = results.
